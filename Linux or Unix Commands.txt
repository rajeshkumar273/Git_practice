Git and Github
--------------
git add
git commit
git push


locally to create a file 
vi hyd
cat hyd
ls hyd

git add . (here dot represents current directory)

git commit -m "just commited (here m stands for message)

git status 


what is push means
------------------
if you want to push your code from the local to remote use

git push


touch hyd

git status

git add .

git status

git commit -m "testing"

git push 




touch kochi

git status

git add .

git status

git commit -m "testing"

git push 


what is pull
------------
getting changes from remote to local

now you can create a file name with "mumbai" and then follwing process

git pull

git status

Unwantly I added one file now I want undo the changes so I would like to use
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	git reset (will undo the changes)
	
	git status


I want to add a file in temporary location
------------------------------------------

	touch kochi

	git add .

	git status
	
	git stash save (stash is a temporary location)
	
	git status


	touch madhurai
	
	git add .

	git status
	
	Now I want to back that kochi file so I am using
	------------------------------------------------

	git stash pop
	
	git status

	git commit -m "Stash PoP application"

I want to see how many branches are there.
------------------------------------------

git branch

here the interview question.

If I do git branch I am not able to see no. of branches so at that what I need to do.

git branch -a 

I want to checkout feature branch
----------------------------------
git checkout feature

touch ameerpet

git add .

git commit -m "JustNow updated"

git merge feature
Alread up to date.

you are in feature branch and merge the same branch.

so for that purpose you want to merge one to another first you need to checkout of the branch.

git checkout main

git merge feature

ls

cat ameerpet

touch kukatpally

git add .

git commit -m "Just Now Kukatpally file is added"

ls

git checkout main

git merge feature

------------------------------------------------------


How to stop merging in git
---------------------------
git merge --abort
# or
git reset --merge



Scanario -2
-----------

		In feature branch

	1)touch vizag

	2)ls
	
	3)git add .

	4)ls

	5)git commit -m "Vizag file added"
	
	6)git checkout main
	
	7)git merge feature

	8)ls

	9)git push         


sometime I have requirement to push feature to feature branch
--------------------------------------------------------------
touch abc

ls

git add .

git commit -m "Just Now abc file added"

git push

Merge conflicts
---------------
before use git pull 

I created bbbbb file in feature branche remotely

but I did not used git pull (bbbbb file not there in local system)

I local system I created cccc
-----------------------------
	touch cccc
	
	git add .
	
	git commit -m "cccc file is added"
	
	if use "git push" is it work what you think.

	if not work because in feature branch I created one new file bbbbb not pulled i.e., that file not in you local system.

	here the conflict is happend.

$ git push
To https://github.com/rajeshkumar273/Kia.git
 ! [rejected]        feature -> feature (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/rajeshkumar273/Kia.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.


that means conflict happend


	
git clone --> for  copy

git pull --> is used to see changes from remote to local

git push --> push code from local to remote

git diff is used to compare the changes

git log --> to get latest commit id's or how many commits we did.

git config
git init
git clone
git add
git commit
git diff
git reset
git status
git rm
git log
git show
git tag
git branch
git checkout
git merge
git remote
git push
git pull
git stash



why we are using brances

	If there is any new requirement directly we will not be able to make changes into main branch.
	
	that's way we are creating new branches.
	
	


I dont want to  pull the changes I just want see the changes.
-------------------------------------------------------------
git fetch vs pull

Git Fetch is the command that tells the local repository 
that there are changes available in the remote repository 
without bringing the changes into the local repository.

Git Pull on the other hand brings the copy of the remote directory changes into the local repository.

git show
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

git pull

git log
--------

	to history of file who added, who changed along with commit id's

git show
--------

	what are new changes are added, deleted given by particular id.

	git show fcfaa8226cc845e0f166656b81db247117b8a11e
	
git revert 
----------

	git revert f54db7f2f5a9b1581b88133c3b61dddf457f35e8

	git revert is used to revert the changes that are previsouly added.

like undo the changes
---------------------
	

How many ways we can authenticate github

	There are two ways
		1.Username and password
		2.Using Token Access

Github is used for storing code

what is the version control system?

	Git is the version control system

	Git is draw the all code changes

Now we are going to use Azure DevOps

Azure is also code storing
--------------------------

	dev.azure.com ----------------> azure devops
	
	portal.azure.com ----------------> azure administration/azure portal
